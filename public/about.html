<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Stephen Fitahiana Andriamalala, but everybody call me Steph. I'm from Madagascar, but I've been living here in Romania for almost one year now. I'm a student, in the field of IT (informatics).</p>

<p>The first time I came here in romania, I didn't understand the language at all. But I took the romaninan language preparatory year, so now about one year later, I can say that I speak pretty much romanian! Deci, hai sa vorbim romaneste!</p>
